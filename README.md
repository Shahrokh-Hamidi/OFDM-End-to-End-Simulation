- This repository contains an end-to-end simulation for a SISO OFDM system
- For the channel estimation these three methods have been implemented:
     - zero forcing
     - matched filtering
     - MMSE

- In the following example the impulse response of the channel has been set as an FIR system with 4 taps: [1, j, 0.1 + 0.5j, 0.2 + 0.2j]
- The snr is 30 dB and the constellation is based on 16 QAM
